# EscapeScreen
Add a Second Escape Key!

Since Minecraft 1.19.3  and above, you can no longer use virtual keyboard inputs. This means if you had rebound your Escpae to something like Caps Lock, it would just not work.
So this mod aims to some what fix that. What it does it adds a second Escape key that you can rebind to any key you want.
